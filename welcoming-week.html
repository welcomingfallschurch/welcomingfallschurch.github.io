    <h3>Past Welcoming Weeks</h3>
    <p>We have celebrated Welcoming Weeks in Falls Church every September since 2018.</p>
    <p>During <strong>Welcoming Week 2023</strong>, Harvey’s hosted our first annual Yacht Club fundraiser.</p>
    <p>During <strong>Welcoming Week 2022,</strong> we launched our Renting to Refugees initiative, a true public-private partnership. We were honored to have Congressman Don Beyer with us. Three refugee families from Afghanistan have since been resettled into Falls Church!</p>
    <p><strong>Welcoming Week 2021</strong> was our biggest yet. The highlight was the launch of our Celebrating Community: Our Stories | A Film Series, sponsoring a showing of Raya and the Last Dragon at Falls Church’s Cherry Hill Park, then hosted a webinar - featuring Disney’s producer and chief cultural advisor of Raya and the Last Dragon! - in honor of Falls Church’s Southeast Asian community and in partnership with Eden Center.</p>
    <p>We observed <strong>Welcoming Week 2020</strong> online because of the pandemic, but our <a href="/files/pick-two.pdf" target="_blank">Pick Two (or more) activities</a> offered lots of options to get involved and Be Welcoming.</p>
    <p><strong>Welcoming Week 2019</strong> saw us welcome Imbolo Mbue, author of Behold the Dreamers, to Falls Church for a <a href="/files/2019-program.pdf" target="_blank">memorable program</a>. Many thanks to FCCPS Superintendent Peter Noonan for making Behold the Dreamers a community book recommendation for Summer 2019 and inspiring so many to read the book - helping us make this event a big success.</p>
    <p><strong>Welcoming Week 2018</strong> was our public launch. Thank you to everyone who has gotten involved over these past four years, and we look forward to all that is to come!</p>
