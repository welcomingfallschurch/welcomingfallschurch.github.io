    <h1>National Welcoming Week | September 13 - 22</h1>
    <p>We again enjoyed celebrating Welcoming Week 2024, as part of the larger Welcoming America movement. Here's a great recap <a href="https://www.fcnp.com/2024/09/19/building-community-welcoming-week-back-in-falls-church/">article</a> from the Falls Church News-Press, and we are grateful for the community’s support for these great activities:</p>
    <p class="descriptor">City of Falls Church City Council Meeting | Monday, Sept 9</p>
    <p class="description">Join us as the City of Falls Church again recognizes National Welcoming Week as Welcoming Week in Falls Church. We appreciate the strong support of and partnership with the City of Falls Church. City Council will recognize us with a proclamation, as we kick off Welcoming Week.</p>
    <p class="descriptor">Author Visit with Sindya Bhanoo | Friday, Sept 13 & Saturday, Sept 14</p>
    <p class="description">Sindya Bhanoo, author of <a href="https://books.catapult.co/books/seeking-fortune-elsewhere/">Seeking Fortune Elsewhere</a>, winner of the 2023 New American Voices award, came to Falls Church! Professor Bhanoo explored topics of immigration, isolation, and coming to America. She shared the story of her own background - including working as a reporter for the New York Times and Washington Post - and how she came to help to tell stories of the immigrant experience through her collection of short stories. She spoke to hundreds of students at Meridian High School on Friday; again at MHS on Saturday morning; and at Mary Riley Styles Public Library on Saturday afternoon.</p>
    <p class="description">Welcoming Falls Church is grateful for partnership with the American Association of University Women, Falls Church City Arts and Humanities, FCCPS, Falls Church Education Foundation, Meridian High School and Mary Riley Styles Library for their co-sponsorship of these events. </p>
    <p class="descriptor">Falls Church Fall Festival | Saturday, Sept 14</p>
    <p class="description">Welcoming Falls Church welcomed the community at our booth at the Fall Festival, on the grounds of the Falls Church Community Center, 223 Little Falls Street, Falls Church. It was our seventh Fall Festival - and we love how Welcoming Week coincides with the Fall Festival each year!</p>
    <p class="descriptor">Unveiling of Welcoming Signage for City Hall | Saturday, Sept 14 </p>
    <p class="description">The Fall Festival was also the venue for the unveiling of welcoming signage that will be mounted outside City Hall, as an expression of the welcoming spirit of the community. Welcoming Falls Church brought together members of the community for a lengthy design and review process and thanks the City for its embrace of welcoming.</p>
    <p class="descriptor">Ice Cream Social | Sunday, Sept 15</p>
    <p class="description">We enjoyed our fifth annual Welcoming Week Ice Cream Social at Mr. Brown’s Park, at the 100 Block of West Broad Street, Falls Church, on Sunday! Visitors enjoyed ice cream from Lil’ City Creamery, met some new neighbors, and listened to live music on a beautiful Sunday afternoon.</p>
    <p class="descriptor">Harvey's Yacht Club Fundraiser | Saturday, Sept 21</p>
    <p class="description">We capped off a great Welcoming Week with another great event at Harvey's, which donated 10% of their second annual Yacht Club fundraiser to Welcoming Falls Church! We love the atmosphere at Harvey’s and are so grateful for their support of Welcoming Falls Church. Likewise, thanks to Clare and Don's which hosted the after party.</p>
    <p class="description">We celebrate Welcoming Week each year in September. Join us next year - September 12-21, 2025 - for another chance to celebrate the spirit of welcoming in Falls Church!
