    <h1>Welcoming Week</h1>
    <p>We had a great Welcoming Week 2021! We kicked off Celebrating Community: Our Stories | A Film Series sponsoring a showing of Raya and the Last Dragon at Falls Church’s Cherry Hill Park, hosted a webinar with the producer and chief cultural advisor of Raya and the Last Dragon that celebrated Falls Church’s Southeast Asian community and in partnership with Eden Center, and - we hope - took another small step towards building a community of neighbors.</p>
    <p>We are also grateful to the City of Falls Church City Council for its <a href="files/2021-welcoming-week-resolution.pdf">resolution</a> again recognizing Welcoming Week in Falls Church!</p>
