        <p>Welcoming Falls Church is building a community of neighbors. How can we do this? Some of this is cultural. We can always smile, prioritize relationships, engage with newcomers (immigrants and otherwise), and bring people together. Culture is contagious, and a welcoming culture brings life.</p>
        <p><b>Coming soon:</b> Alan Gratz joins Welcoming Falls Church on October 28, 2020, for a virtual discussion of his New York Times bestselling novel, Refugee. This award-winning book follows three children at three different points in time, all connected by the same goal: escape. <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">Email us</a> if you would like to join us at 4-5pm for the online program - and we'll send you event login information, and see <a href="/activities/learn/refugee">here</a> for some great resources that we have brought together, to support and inspire young readers of Refugee!</p>
    </div>
    <p>In addition, to achieve our goals of hospitality to immigrants and refugees, opportunity for us all, and a more welcoming community, we encourage you to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="/activities/learn">learn</a>, with recommendations about books, other resources, and public programs;</li>
    <li><a href="/activities/serve">serve</a>, with year-round opportunities to serve in the community; and</li>
    <li><a href="/activities/live">live</a> together, in gatherings that bring like-minded people together for public events.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Also, you should know that Welcoming Falls Church has activities year-round, but we'd highlight:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Conversation and Community Service Week, coming next year on April 17-24, 2021 (hopefully including outdoor activities that can bring us together!); and</li>
        <li>Welcoming Week, next year September 10-19, 2021 (and by then we’ll definitely be together again—we hope?).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We hope you can join us. For more information about upcoming activities, explore ways to <a href="/activities/learn">learn</a>, <a href="activities/serve">serve</a>, and <a href="/activities/live">live</a>&mdash;together, to build a community of neighbors.</p>
