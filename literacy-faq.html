    <h1>Family and Adult Literacy Center</h1>
    <h3>What is literacy?</h3>
    <p>Literacy is defined as the ability to use printed materials (reading and writing) at a level adequate to function and succeed in society.</p>
    <h3>What is family literacy?</h3>
    <p>Family literacy is based on the premise that parents are their child’s first teacher. Family literacy programs take on different forms, depending on the needs of the community. They all share one goal: strengthening families and communities through education.</p>
    <h3>How will Welcoming Falls Church’s Adult & Family Literacy Center help immigrants and refugees?</h3>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church’s goal is to create a community of neighbors where all members feel welcome and included. Our Adult & Family Literacy Center is focused on helping immigrants and refugees (and others who need to learn English) gain the skills they need to become successful and thrive in our community. Our pilot program will focus on improving each student’s knowledge of the English language by offering English language and literacy classes. As part of our curriculum, we will also invite community leaders to speak about local programs and initiatives. As our program grows, we will expand our offerings to include family mentorship and tutoring programs, Parent and Child Together (PACT) activities, and more, to benefit the whole community.</p>
    <h3>Do you have to be a parent to take English classes at the Center?</h3>
    <p>Any adult in the Falls Church area who wants to improve his/her/their English literacy and language skills is welcome to join us! We believe that healthy communities thrive when everyone is included.</p>
    <h3>Do you have to be a resident of Falls Church City to participate in the program activities?</h3>
    <p>Our classes and programs will be open to all residents of the greater Falls Church area. We will give priority to residents of the City of Falls Church for registration. Any spots not filled by residents after the initial registration period will be open to those residing in the greater Falls Church area.</p>
    <h3>Where and when will classes take place?</h3>
    <p>Classes will be held at Oak Street Elementary on Tuesday and Thursday evenings at Oak Street Elementary School from 6:30-8:30pm beginning the week of February 14th and ending the week of May 5th. (No classes the week of April 11th-Spring Break)</p>
    <h3>How can I register for classes?</h3>
    <p>In person registration will be held at Oak Street Elementary School on Tuesday, January 18th at Oak Street Elementary School (cafeteria). Late registration will be held at James Lee Community Center on Saturday, February 5th)</p>
    <h3>Will childcare be provided for children of adult English learners?</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, we cannot provide childcare this spring, but as we expand our offerings and identify needs, childcare may be offered.</p>
