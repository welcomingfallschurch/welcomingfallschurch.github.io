    <h1>Welcoming Landlord Network</h1>

    <p>Housing - especially affordable housing - is in short supply in Northern Virginia, making Welcoming Falls Church’s Welcoming Landlord Network a crucial part of our effort to welcome refugees to the community.</p>
    <p><strong>Our response?</strong> The inspiration for us to consider developing a Welcoming Landlord Network in Falls Church was a public-private initiative in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh’s <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/wp/renting-to-refugees">Renting to Refugees in Allegheny County</a> program is well-documented in a <a href="https://welcomingamerica.org/resource/new-homes-for-new-refugees-a-template-for-creating-a-welcoming-landlord-network-in-your-community/">webinar produced by Welcoming America</a>, and Pittsburgh provides us lessons learned through its successful <a href="https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/15674_Creating_your_Welcoming_Landlord_Network.pdf">Building a Welcoming Landlord Network</a> campaign – which has attracted dozens of landlord participants.</p>
    <p><strong>Why do landlords benefit from renting to refugees?</strong> Refugees may start with little, but their success over time is well-documented. What’s more, refugees resettling in Falls Church will have support from the community that will ease their integration into the community. See the image on this page of an apartment furnished for a refugee family. If we can be a welcoming community - and if our <a href="/initiatives/support-teams">Support Teams</a> and <a href="/initiatives/literacy-center">Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center</a> can support families each step along their resettlement path - we look forward to inspiring success stories over time. This is true of families benefiting from the <a href="/initiatives/renting-to-refugees">Renting to Refugees</a> program, and we also hope it is true for families not in that program, but who move to Falls Church for other reasons.</p>
    <p><strong>A message to landlords.</strong> Would you like to learn more about partnering with Welcoming Falls Church to join our Welcoming Landlord Network? Email <a href="mailto:rachelsunden@gmail.com">Rachel Sunden</a> or <a href="mailto:kevinhurst@me.com">Kevin Hurst</a>, co-heads of our Housing Task Force, and we look forward to speaking.</p>
    <p><strong>Do you rent your single-family home?</strong> Importantly, single-family homeowners who rent all or part of their homes are also eligible to participate in our Welcoming Landlord Network! Given high rent levels in Falls Church, single-family homeowners will need offer refugee families below-market rent – but those that have the heart to help the community welcome refugees can count on Welcoming Falls Church services provided to families that rent their homes.</p>
