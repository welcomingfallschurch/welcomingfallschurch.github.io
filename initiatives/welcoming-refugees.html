    <h1>Welcoming Refugees</h1>
    <p>Many in Falls Church support the resettlement of refugees in the area. Falls Church's Eden Center shows that we can successfully welcome refugees. Many Southeast Asian refugees settled in the area the 1970s and 1980s. That wave of resettlement eventually led to Eden Center becoming the center for Vietnamese culture and commerce on the East Coast. This is <a href="https://littlesaigonclarendon.com/the-history">fascinating local history</a>, worth exploring, and inspiring for those that would like to see the community welcome more refugees.</p>

        <p>Falls Church is responding to the call to welcome refugees! We are welcoming five refugee families to the City of Falls Church with rent assistance through our <a href="/initiatives/renting-to-refugees">Renting to Refugees</a> initiative, and more across Greater Falls Church with English language training, job search/mentorship support, and connections with the local schools. See below for how to get involved, and to help us become a community that welcomes refugees well.</p>

    <p><strong>Falls Church Welcoming Refugees Fund</strong>. This is an innovative, public-private effort to make housing more affordable for refugees. Welcoming Falls Church is grateful for the City of Falls Church’s support of our <a href="/initiatives/renting-to-refugees">Renting to Refugees</a> initiative. The City supported this initiative by allocating $50,000 and is considering additional support. The Fund will pays part of the rent for these families through their second year in Falls Church, to make rent more affordable and support their resettlement in the community.</p>
    <p><strong>GET INVOLVED</strong>. We are organizing to welcome refugees well in Falls Church starting with Support Teams that engage directly with each family. Please consider the following. Click on the links below to learn more about how to get involved.</p>

    <p>Our priorities at the moment are 1) to continue to form a sixth Support Team that will engage directly with a family arriving early in 2025 and help us welcome them well to the community, 2) address the limited supply of affordable housing by developing our <a href="/initiatives/welcoming-landlord-network">Welcoming Landlord Network</a> to permit us to welcome more families, and 3) focusing on employment and helping employable adults - especially a second employable spouse - in newly-resettled families find jobs. Learn more about Support Teams <a href="/initiatives/support-teams">here</a> as one way to get involved and about our community-wide Donation Drive <a href="/initiatives/donation-drive">here</a>.</p>
