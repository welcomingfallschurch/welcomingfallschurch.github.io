    <h1>Welcoming Refugees</h1>
    <p>Many in Falls Church support the resettlement of refugees in the area. Falls Church's Eden Center shows that we can successfully welcome refugees. Many Southeast Asian refugees settled in the area the 1970s and 1980s. That wave of resettlement eventually led to Eden Center becoming the center for Vietnamese culture and commerce on the East Coast. This is <a href="https://littlesaigonclarendon.com/the-history">fascinating local history</a>, worth exploring, and inspiring for those that would like to see the community welcome more refugees.</p>
    <h2>Think Globally, Serve Locally</h2>
    <p>Consider getting involved in refugee resettlement locally:</p>
    <p><strong>Housing</strong>. We all know how expensive housing is in this area. Help us make housing more affordable, to say "yes in my backyard" to refugee resettlement here.</p>

    <p>We are working on an initiative called <strong>Renting to Refugees</strong>. This is a public-private initiative to engage landlords, encourage them to rent to refugees locally, and subsidize rent to make living in Falls Church affordable for recently-resettled families.</p>
    <p>To learn more, view <a href="https://welcomingamerica.org/resource/new-homes-for-new-refugees-a-template-for-creating-a-welcoming-landlord-network-in-your-community/">this Welcoming America webinar</a> about Building a Welcoming Landlord Network or <a href="/assets/Renting to Refugees Backgrounder.pdf">download our Renting to Refugees backgrounder</a>.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Our vision is that this initiative will attract the support of the City of Falls Church as well as private supporters, and that it would enable our community to welcome five refugee families in the next six to 12 months</em></strong><em>.</em> This initiative kicked off publicly with a Roundtable Discussion on Renting to Refugees in Falls Church on Tuesday, March 23, at the Mary Riley Styles Public Library. <a href="/assets/Renting to Refugees Roundtable Attendees - 2022.03.22.pdf" target="_blank">Twenty representatives of resettlement agencies and key City of Falls Church stakeholders</a> came together to learn about the process of refugee resettlement. We held a second public meeting on Wednesday, April 6, at Meridian High School. We heard from Holly Herrera, Section Chief in the State Department’s Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration/Domestic Resettlement; colleagues from Catholic Charities-Diocese of Arlington Migration & Refugee Services; and members of the community in small groups, about what it will take to make refugee resettlement work in Falls Church.</p>
    <p>We continue to introduce this initiative around the community, but we are thinking more and more deeply about gaps – and what we’ll need to do to resettlement work well for the families resettled here. </p>
    <p>We think that we have momentum that will enable us to launch this program in the coming months. We invite you to join us. Help us welcome five refugee families to the community in the next six to 12 months. First, <a href="/initiatives/renting-to-refugees">learn more about the Renting to Refugees initiative</a>, then <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">email us</a> to get involved!</p>
    <p>English Language and Literacy Instruction. After securing housing, English language and literacy instruction is one of the most significant needs for recently-resettled refugees. To help meet this need, Welcoming Falls Church recently launched an <a href="/initiatives/literacy-center">Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center</a>, in partnership with the <a href="https://lcnv.org/">Literacy Council of Northern Virginia</a> and the <a href="https://www.fccps.org/">Falls Church City Public Schools</a>. During our Spring 2022 pilot program, classes meet on Tuesday and Thursday evenings at Oak Street Elementary (OSE). In addition to these classes, we offer supplemental one-on-one tutoring.</p>
    <p>We strive to meet the needs of each and every individual in need of literacy and language education. As we grow and expand our services to welcome and support more refugees in our community, we will need more volunteers to serve in the <a href="/initiatives/literacy-center">Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center</a>. Please consider donating your time and talent by serving as a lead teacher, class aide, or tutor, to provide transportation services to and from classes, or to provide child care to children of students during classes. To learn more about the center or to volunteer, please complete an interest form <a href="https://forms.gle/W8YEHtSnXwiWVepT9">here</a>.</p>
    <p>We need tutors for recently-resettled adults and children, and we will need more if our Renting to Refugees initiative succeeds. To learn more and volunteer, please complete an interest form <a href="https://forms.gle/W8YEHtSnXwiWVepT9">here</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Children's Books for Families. </strong>Fifth graders at Oak Street Elementary initiated a children's book donation drive for refugees earlier this year, and the community responded! Kids and families at Mt. Daniel and Oak Street donated over 1500 books. The Meridian High School GIVE Day Club along with adult volunteers have been leveling the books, so that we can get the right books in the hands of the right children. </p>
    <p>We have distributed about 500 of these books, so we don't need donations of additional children's books yet - but we are learning more about what's needed and how to distribute books through various channels. Based on our work to date, we think this is strategic, connects to development of our <a href="/initiatives/literacy-center.html">Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center</a>, and is a niche our community can fill, so watch for more on this topic.</p>
    <p><strong>Apartment Furnishing.</strong> Many of you have expressed interest in helping to furnish apartments for families settled here in Falls Church. 12 Falls Church residents had an amazing experience furnishing three apartments in Riverdale Park and Lanham, Maryland, last fall &ndash; see photos <a href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/englishnow/x1170n">here</a> &ndash; and two Daisy Girl Scout troops even did "Welcome Cards" for those families. We look forward to organizing groups for families we settle locally in our "Renting to Refugees" program! <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">Email us</a> to be put on the list to receive information when that happines! </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>Other ways to serve.</strong> In addition to serving with us, we encourage you to consider other ways to get involved working with refugees with our partners at two of the area's resettlement agencies, <a href="https://lssnca.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjwoduRBhA4EiwACL5RP13MWT1N179Kh3j55-wE2anfHOJRWZo_eAT8p_qnolcsTrnuqha8wBoCc4sQAvD_BwE">Lutheran Social Services</a> and <a href="https://www.ccda.net/need-help/immigrants-and-refugees/migration-and-refugee-services/">Catholic Charities-Diocese of Arlington Migration &amp; Refugee Services</a>. Please contact LSS and/or CCDA directly or ask us for an introduction. These are great organizations and deserve our support.</p>
