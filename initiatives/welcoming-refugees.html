    <h1>Welcoming Refugees</h1>
    <p>Many in Falls Church support the resettlement of refugees in the area. Falls Church's Eden Center shows that we can successfully welcome refugees. Many Southeast Asian refugees settled in the area the 1970s and 1980s. Originally concentrated in Clarendon, that wave of resettlement eventually led to Eden Center becoming the center for Vietnamese culture and commerce on the East Coast. This is <a href="https://littlesaigonclarendon.com/the-history">fascinating local history</a>, worth exploring, and inspiring for those that would like to see the community welcome more refugees.</p>
    <h2>Think Globally, Serve Locally</h2>
    <p>Consider getting involved in refugee resettlement locally:</p>
    <p><strong>Housing</strong>. We all know how expensive housing is in this area. Help us make housing more affordable, to say "yes in my backyard" to refugee resettlement here.</p>
    <p>We are working on an initiative called <strong>Renting to Refugees</strong>. This is a public-private initiative to engage landlords, encourage them to rent to refugees locally, and subsidize rent to make living in Falls Church affordable for recently-resettled families. To learn more, view <a href="https://welcomingamerica.org/resource/new-homes-for-new-refugees-a-template-for-creating-a-welcoming-landlord-network-in-your-community/">this Welcoming America webinar</a> on how this proven model works or <a href="/assets/Renting to Refugees Backgrounder.pdf">download our Renting to Refugees backgrounder</a>.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Our vision is that this initiative will attract the support of the City of Falls Church as well as private supporters, and that it would enable our community to welcome five to 10 refugee families in the next six to 12 months</em></strong><em>. </em>This initiative is gathering momentum - it's quite exciting - <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">email us</a> to get involved!</p>
    <p><strong>ESOL Tutoring</strong>. After securing housing, ESOL tutoring is one of the next most significant needs for recently-resettled refugees. You may know that Welcoming Falls Church recently launched an Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center, in partnership with the Literacy Council of Northern Virginia and the Falls Church City Public Schools. These classes meet Tuesday and Thursday evenings at Oak Street Elementar. This is a great resource in the community, but unfortunately most refugees don't have transportation, and even those that are enrolled benefit from supplemental tutoring. </p>
    <p>We need tutors for recently-resettled adults and children, and we will need more if our Renting to Refugees initiative succeeds. To learn more and volunteer, please complete an interest form <a href="https://forms.gle/W8YEHtSnXwiWVepT9">here</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Children's Books for Families. </strong>Fifth graders at Oak Street Elementary initiated a children's book donation drive for refugees earlier this year, and the community responded! Kids and families at Mt. Daniel and Oak Street donated over 1500 books. The Meridian High School GIVE Day Club along with adult volunteers have been leveling the books, so that we can get the right books in the hands of the right children. </p>
    <p>We have distributed about 500 of these books, so we don't need donations of additional children's books yet - but we are learning more about what's needed and how to distribute books through various channels. Based on our work to date, we think this is strategic, connects to development of our <a href="/initiatives/literacy-center.html">Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center</a>, and is a niche our community can fill, so watch for more on this topic.</p>
    <p><strong>Apartment Furnishing.</strong> Many of you have expressed interest in helping to furnish apartments for families settled here in Falls Church. 12 Falls Church residents had an amazing experience furnishing three apartments in Riverdale Park and Lanham, Maryland, last fall &ndash; see photos <a href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/englishnow/x1170n">here</a> &ndash; and two Daisy Girl Scout troops even did "Welcome Cards" for those families. We look forward to organizing groups for families we settle locally in our "Renting to Refugees" program! <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">Email us</a> to be put on the list to receive information when that happines! </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p><strong>Other ways to serve.</strong> In addition to serving with us, we encourage you to consider other ways to get involved working with refugees with our partners at two of the area's resettlement agencies, <a href="https://lssnca.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjwoduRBhA4EiwACL5RP13MWT1N179Kh3j55-wE2anfHOJRWZo_eAT8p_qnolcsTrnuqha8wBoCc4sQAvD_BwE">Lutheran Social Services</a> and <a href="https://www.ccda.net/need-help/immigrants-and-refugees/migration-and-refugee-services/">Catholic Charities-Diocese of Arlington Migration &amp; Refugee Services</a>. Please contact LSS and/or CCDA directly or ask us for an introduction. These are great organizations and deserve our support.</p>
