    <p>In addition to partial rent support, we are organizing to welcome refugee families well. We are forming Support Teams - each with eight to ten adults, who complete adult and child protection, cultural, and trauma awareness training - and who play defined roles supporting a family as they settle in the area.</p>
    <p>Over 110 people have stepped forward to join a Support Team or otherwise lend volunteer support to the Welcoming Refugees effort so far, as we build a community of neighbors by making Falls Church more welcoming to refugees.</p>
