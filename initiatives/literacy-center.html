        <p>Here at the Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center, we are passionate about welcoming immigrants and refugees to our community. Helping new Americans learn English flows naturally from a welcoming spirit while also providing them with the skills they need to integrate fully into our community. We strive to provide a vibrant learning environment where students get to know their neighbors and learn about opportunities that will help them thrive.</p>

    <p>We invite you to learn more about literacy and what we do. Responses to some frequently asked questions are below.</p>
    <h3>How does Welcoming Falls Church's Adult & Family Literacy Center help immigrants and refugees?</h3>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church's goal is to create a community of neighbors where everyone feels welcome and included. Our Adult &amp; Family Literacy Center is focused on helping immigrants and refugees gain the literacy and language skills they need to thrive in our community. As part of our curriculum, we also invite community leaders to speak about local programs and initiatives. We also provide childcare with a literacy focus to the children, ages 4-12, of adults enrolled in English literacy classes, through our Children's Literacy Activities Program (CLAP!). We are particularly thankful to the high school students who make this program a success. Email us with questions about our classes or to register your child for CLAP!</p>
