    <h1>Advocate</h1>
    <p>Welcoming Falls Church cares about issues that affect immigrants and refugees. Our Research & Policy Advisory Committee (RPAC) is engaging City of Falls Church, Fairfax County, and Northern Virginia Regional Commission (NVRC) authorities on issues that matter to our community.</p>
    <p>Our goals are hospitality toward immigrants and refugees and opportunity for us all. To achieve these goals, we will need to consider how our communities can be more welcoming not only in word but in practice.</p>
    <p>We're taking a serious look at local policies that affect refugee resettlement, housing policy, and more. Refugee resettlement policy is a particular focus of late. We celebrate how Falls Church's Eden Center has become the center of Vietnamese culture and commerce on the East Coast, in the wake of the settlement of so many SE Asian refugees in the 1970s and 1980. We wonder how the community will respond to the challenge of resettling Afghan and other refugees in the coming months and years.</p>
    <p>Join us for a meeting of the Research & Policy Advisory Committee at the Mary Riley Styles Public Library, 120 North Virginia Avenue, Falls Church, VA 22046, the first Wednesday of each month, 7:30-8:30pm. Please <a href="mailto:welcomingfallschurch@gmail.com">contact</a> RPAC Co-Chairs Swati Ghosh or Paul Boesen for more information.</p>
